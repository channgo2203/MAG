This test implements a program consisting of 3 threads. Each thread has 2 synchronization 
points (3 segments) using waits statements. Therefore, there are totally (3!)^3 = 216 
execution orders.
 
To compile:
make

To run:
./sweep_ex3 [number of runs]

If a number of runs is not provided, then the model is run until all possible execution 
orders is reached. The report presents the scheduler coverage (the number of different 
execution orders by the maxmum number of possible execition orders) and the verification 
efficiency (the number of different execution orders by the number of runs)
